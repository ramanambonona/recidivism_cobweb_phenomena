# recidivism and adapative expectation
The idea that the punishment imposed on the offender depends on his previous conviction is widely discussed in the economic literature. Previous work has argued for the importance of punishing repeat offenders less severely than first-time or novice offenders ([Polinsky & Rubinfeld, 1911](https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-2727(91)90009-q);  [Chu et al., 2000}(https://doi.org/10.1016/S0144-8188(00)00024-77); [Shavell, 2004](https://doi.org/10.4159/9780674043497); [Miceli & Bucci, 2005](https://doi.org/10.2202/1555-5879.1011); [MÃ¼ller & Schmitz, 2015)(https://doi.org/10.2202/1555-5879.1011)). [Shavell, 2004](https://doi.org/10.4159/9780674043497) argued that making sanctions dependent on the history of offences can be advantageous even when there are no characteristics to be known. In the same line of reasoning, @Shavell2004 pointed out that when "the detection of a violation implies not only an immediate sanction, but also a higher sanction for a future violation, an individual will be more deterred from committing a violation now" [p. 529].
